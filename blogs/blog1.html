Blog: Morning 11:30, I was sitting on my Swing-Board when I came across this Idea of re-making my personal Website.
It was a Lot of work today but I made this website any way. First of all I had to Completely start this Project from scratch,<br>
so I Started by searching for some personal websites. Then I came across *Youtuber*bugswriter's Website. Dunno if you follow himbr>
but he is a great guy His channel is Linux Based(arch jokes). Then I copied his code (the base obviously and cmmon'br>
my website is totally diffrent). So proceeding further, I replaced the Bio-G with mine and then the other information and codes.br>
br>
Same day I had a Tuition class exam, Went great. But Yesterday's exam result came #ShittyFaceEmoji# I got 12.5/45 still I was ranked 3rd in class
I mean that is alot weird. Now late-afternoon 5:10 I arrived at home and after refreshing I told my mom about this and guess what she said ? <br>
"Get is Signed by your Father." Now you know it and i Know it what is next... wish me luck.
So, this is the story of my day when I truly created this website. I dunno If any one would be interested in learning this information but still
it is there.<br>
